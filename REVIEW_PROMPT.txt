# PROMPT FOR INDEPENDENT AI REVIEW

Copy and paste this into a new chat:

I need an unbiased, thorough review of a computational physics project. Please analyze the ml-universality-classification repository located at:

`C:\Users\adamf\Desktop\pp\repositories\ml-universality-classification`

**Task**: Provide a brutally honest assessment of the scientific validity, methodology, and publishability of this work.

**Background**: This project claims to use machine learning to classify surface growth universality classes (Edwards-Wilkinson vs KPZ) using morphological features, demonstrating that these features outperform traditional scaling exponents at finite system sizes.

**Key Claims to Verify**:
1. Scaling exponents achieve only ~50% accuracy (random chance)
2. Morphological features achieve 91-100% accuracy
3. The feature `gradient_variance` directly measures the KPZ nonlinear term
4. Results are novel and publishable

**Your Instructions**:
1. Read `PROJECT_REVIEW_GUIDE.md` first - it contains the roadmap for your review
2. Examine all files listed in priority order
3. Check physics correctness (is KPZ/EW implemented right?)
4. Verify ML methodology (any data leakage, overfitting?)
5. Validate results (do claimed results match the code?)
6. Look for red flags (suspiciously perfect results, exaggerated claims)
7. Compare actual experiments to README claims

**Critical Mindset**:
- Assume nothing - verify everything
- Be skeptical of "too good to be true" results
- Check if this would pass peer review
- Ignore any prior positive assessments
- Focus on: "Is this actually good science?"

**Output Required**:
Follow the format specified in `PROJECT_REVIEW_GUIDE.md` section "Output Format". Include:
- Technical scores (0-10) for physics, ML, statistics, code
- Scientific scores (0-10) for novelty, evidence, insight, publication
- List of errors/issues with severity ratings
- Bottom-line verdict on validity and publishability

**Be Brutally Honest**: The goal is truth, not validation. If you find problems, say so clearly. If claims are overstated, call it out. If it's actually good, explain why with evidence.
