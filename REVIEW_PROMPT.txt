This is an anomaly detection project for surface growth universality classes.

**What it does**: Train Isolation Forest on Edwards-Wilkinson and KPZ surfaces, then detect surfaces from unknown dynamics (MBE, conserved-KPZ, quenched-disorder KPZ) without requiring labels for those classes.

**Main results**:
- 100% detection of unknown classes at L=128, 256, 512
- Cross-scale: train at L=128, test at L=512, still works
- Gradient features alone: 100% detection
- Traditional α,β exponents alone: 79% detection
- Time-dependence: known classes converge over time, unknown stay separated

**Key files**:
- src/anomaly_detection.py - main detector
- src/feature_ablation.py - which features matter
- src/quick_time_test.py - time-dependence validation
- PAPER_OUTLINE.md - draft paper with all results

**Questions for review**:
1. Is the physics implementation correct (EW, KPZ, MBE equations)?
2. Is the ML methodology sound (no data leakage, proper validation)?
3. Are the claims supported by the results?
4. What's missing for a journal submission?
